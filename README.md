# Weather Application

A simple weather application implemented with React TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and the goal of this project is to create a simple application interface and know how to implement and integrate the OpenWeather API into the application.

# Technologies used
- React (TypeScript)
- TailwindCSS
- API: OpenWeather API
- Axios library

# Process
Firstly, the API key is retrieved from the OpenWeather website itself, then it is going to be stored in .env file for security issue. Then, in the api file, the key is imported along with the API base url to fetch the weather data and display the weather forecast on the screen.

# Demo

# Backside
The weather application has not been completely done due to limitation of resource access. The attempt to utilise daily and hourly weather is unsuccessful due to not subscribing to the offer of OpenWeather API.

# Further improvement
Later, the application will be made to improve with more features, such as:
- Responsive design
- More resource access to hourly and daily weather
- Dark/Light mode implementation
- More friendly-user features to improve the experience
